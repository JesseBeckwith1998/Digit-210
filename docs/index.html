	<hr>

	<p>I am a double major in History and DIGIT</p>
	<p>I chose History to start my college career because of interest in the subject since i was very young, however i decided upon getting a second major in DIGIT <br>because of my love of data analysis. I also have come to enjoy coding because it really fun to create programs and to design websites!</br> </p>
	<p>I am 22 years old and this is my 5th year at Penn State, i am an avid historian, especially in pre-soviet history as well as the rise of communism in russia. I have 2 research papers on russia.<br> 10th century russia and then the other is the rise of bolshevisim in russia. I deeply interested in data analysis and coding. I am still new to DIGIT but this is something i feel i should have been doing from the start of college.</br><br>I am looking forward to continuing my education in DIGIT and getting a job working as a data analyst or website designer</br> </p>
