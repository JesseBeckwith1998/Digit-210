<p>Reflection Post</p>
<p>I built two websites recently, one using GitHub and HTML and the other using sites.psu.edu/wordpress.</p>
<p>Word Press makes it easier to get a site up and running, however, I experienced a plethora of issues while building it.</p>
<p>1. I couldn't get specific posts to appear on specific pages. I could only get all my posts to appear on one page or on my homepage.</p>
<p>2. WordPress makes it difficult to create headings and to use images as you cannot freely move images, only through left, right, and center alignment.</p>
<p>3. While there are a lot of options in terms of choosing a theme for your website, I felt like it was difficult to decide on one as it was hard to imagine my content on the pre-built theme.</p>
<p>The plus side of WordPress would be that it is indeed very easy to get a site up and running. Very quick to make posts and to upload media like pictures or videos. It is extremely easy to create links and embeds them into your webpages. Also with WordPress, you can choose to create your posts/pages using HTML which if you are able to code correctly can lead to creating the perfect website for your content. I have used WordPress before and again yes it is easier, I just do not like it all that much as I feel as though it is limiting and difficult to work with at times.</p>
<p>The second website I built was though github.com and I used HTML and CSS coding. I am not very skilled in those coding languages so my website isn't the greatest, but the possibilities are endless and eventually, I will be able to make the perfect website.</p>
<p>Though, for now, is limited it was difficult to format HTML, and internal CSS coding is difficult at times but can make your website beautiful if you know how to use it. I However have very little experience using it, but the only way for me to learn to use it.</p>
<p>The advantage of using WordPress over GitHub is it is significantly quicker to get a website up and running and made to look pretty. using GitHub requires the coding of some sort whether its markdown or HTML + CSS coding. however, GitHub can be used to make much prettier websites that fit more of how you want your site to look like. WordPress is just too limited.</p>
<p>I would like to become more proficient and HTML and CSS in order to develop better websites in the future.</p>
